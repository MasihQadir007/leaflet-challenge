# Earthquake Visualisation with Leaflet

## Overview

This project aims to visualize earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) using Leaflet, a JavaScript library for interactive maps.

### Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualisation

#### Dataset

The earthquake data is sourced from the USGS GeoJSON Feed. We selected a dataset from the past 7 days for visualization.

#### Implementation

- The data is imported and visualized on a Leaflet map.
- Each earthquake is represented by a marker on the map.
- Marker size reflects the earthquake magnitude, and color indicates the depth of the earthquake.
- Popups provide additional information about each earthquake when clicked.
- A legend is included to provide context for the map data.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main parts:

- **Leaflet-Part-1**: Contains the code for visualizing earthquake data as per Part 1 of the challenge.

- **Leaflet-Part-2**: Optional part for gathering and plotting additional data. Currently not implemented.

## Getting Started

To run the visualization locally:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the relevant part directory.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
